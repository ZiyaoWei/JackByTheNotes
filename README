Jack By The Notes Simple music playing tool with JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK). JACK is a very cool audio system, but using it is not the most intuitive thing, and there lacks tutorial/book with appropriate depth on this system. This small library/tool begins as a part of my Motion Capture project, and can both be used as a simple interface/facade of JACK, and as a small example of how to use JACK.
